## Description
Advent of Code 2023 is a collection of 24 challenges that you can solve choosing the tool of your preference, from pen and paper to your fav coding language. I've decided to tackle the challenges using Python.

For each challenge, I've created a folder. In the folder you can find the instructions given and my code to find the solution.
